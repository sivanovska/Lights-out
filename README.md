# Lights-out

Welcome to Lights-Out.

Lights-Out is a web application where you can play an engaging puzzle game. Upon entering the page, you'll find yourself on the game page, ready to start playing. Customize your game experience by choosing the dimensions of the matrix and click "Generate Matrix" to create a grid filled with randomly placed light and dark cells.

The aim of the game is to turn off all the lights. Clicking on a cell toggles its state along with adjacent cells. Strategically plan your moves to transform all light cells into dark ones. Upon successful completion, a popup will congratulate you on solving the puzzle. If you find yourself stuck, you can use the "Get Solution" button to reveal the steps to solve the puzzle. The cells you need to click in order to solve the matrix will be marked with white dots. Simply click on each marked cell to advance through the solution steps. However, if the generated matrix is not solvable, you will receive an error message indicating that there is no solution.

Alternatively, you can choose the "Create" button from the navigation menu to design your own puzzle. Define the dimensions of the matrix and customize the initial configuration by toggling individual cells on and off. Once you're satisfied with your creation, use the "Check Solvability" button to determine if your puzzle is solvable.

Lights-Out provides a challenging and interactive experience. Play existing puzzles or try designing new ones.
